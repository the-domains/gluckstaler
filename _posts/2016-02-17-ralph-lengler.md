**UX Designer / Architect & Business Analyst / Strategist**

# **RALPH ****LENGLER**

I believe technology should empower people and make them feel awesome. It should assist and connect them, be unobtrusive and letting them focus on getting things done.

With my background in Information Visualization, Design & Human Factors, I'm a specialist in integrating skills and knowledge across domains, like Usability, Design, Tech /IT, Business, & Media.

My goal is to create better products & services using a human centered design approach.

Discussion and business partners describe me as an enthousiastic, solution & detailed-oriented, self-motivated teamplayer.
